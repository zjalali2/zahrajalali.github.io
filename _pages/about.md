Hello! I’m Zahra Jalali, an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) with a Ph.D. in Operations Management from McGill University, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. [Maxime Cohen](https://maxccohen.github.io/) and Prof. [Mehmet Gumus](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/mehmet-gumus). My expertise lies in the intersection of **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Causal Inference, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**, through which I deliver impactful solutions that enhance operational efficiency and improve customer engagement.

I bring a unique blend of rigorous academic foundations and practical, industry-driven solutions, specializing in creating **scalable, AI-powered frameworks** that support informed decision-making and elevate customer engagement.

## Professional Impact at Amazon

In my role at Amazon Web Services, I apply expertise in data science, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs) to create impactful solutions that optimize customer experiences and streamline operational efficiency. Key contributions include:

- **LLM Integration and Deployment**: I design and deploy large language model (LLM)-based workflows using frameworks like LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), driving enhanced customer support through precision-focused AI applications that prioritize safety and relevance.

- **Predictive Analytics and Payment Optimization**: Leveraging machine learning frameworks, including PyTorch and TensorFlow, I develop predictive models that improve transaction success rates, reduce payment failures, and minimize customer friction. My experience spans A/B testing, causal inference, and real-time analytics to deliver data-driven insights and performance improvements across global platforms.

- **Operational Cost Efficiency**: I optimize transactional workflows by developing models that address routing efficiency and ensure compliance with payment volume commitments, directly impacting Amazon’s cost of payments (COP) and operational scalability.

- **Advanced Data Analytics for Decision-Making**: Using comprehensive data-driven methodologies, I interpret complex datasets and provide insights that guide customer-focused decisions, enhance engagement, and support Amazon’s strategic goals.

This experience reflects my commitment to applying advanced AI and machine learning to solve complex, large-scale challenges and to drive continuous improvement in customer satisfaction and operational performance.

## Research Contributions & Publications

I have contributed to high-impact journals, including the *European Journal of Operational Research* and the *Journal of Corporate Finance*, with research spanning **retail operations, healthcare, supply chain management, and AI applications**. My recent projects include the analysis of treatment time in emergency departments, experimental studies on product placement strategies, and the application of LLMs to improve online customer service experiences.

## Future Directions

Moving forward, my research will continue to expand the applications of LLMs and Machine Learning in **retail and healthcare**. By merging **causal inference, experimental design, and scalable AI tools**, I aim to develop AI-driven solutions that address complex operational challenges in a strategic, results-oriented manner.
