Hello! I’m Zahra Jalali, an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) with a Ph.D. in Operations Management from McGill University, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. [Maxime Cohen](https://maxccohen.github.io/) and Prof. [Mehmet Gumus](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/mehmet-gumus). My expertise lies in the intersection of **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Causal Inference, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**, through which I deliver impactful solutions that enhance operational efficiency and improve customer engagement.

I bring a unique blend of rigorous academic foundations and practical, industry-driven solutions, specializing in creating **scalable, AI-powered frameworks** that support informed decision-making and elevate customer engagement.
## Professional Impact at Amazon

In my role at Amazon, I utilize my expertise in **LLM development, machine learning, and data science** to achieve significant business outcomes across several key domains:

- **Advanced LLM Agent Development with RAG and LangChain:** I design and deploy advanced LLM-based agents that leverage RAG and LangChain to optimize customer support interactions. By integrating retrieval-based responses, these agents enhance the accuracy and relevance of answers to complex customer queries, contributing to Amazon’s commitment to delivering world-class customer experiences.

- **Optimization of Payment Journeys Through Data Science:** Utilizing **A/B testing, causal inference, and predictive modeling**, I develop data-driven models to reduce transaction failures and customize payment options, directly influencing customer satisfaction and operational cost efficiency on Amazon’s global platform.

## Research Contributions & Publications

I have contributed to high-impact journals, including the *European Journal of Operational Research* and the *Journal of Corporate Finance*, with research spanning **retail operations, healthcare, supply chain management, and AI applications**. My recent projects include the analysis of treatment time in emergency departments, experimental studies on product placement strategies, and the application of LLMs to improve online customer service experiences.

## Future Directions

Moving forward, my research will continue to expand the applications of LLMs and Machine Learning in **retail and healthcare**. By merging **causal inference, experimental design, and scalable AI tools**, I aim to develop AI-driven solutions that address complex operational challenges in a strategic, results-oriented manner.
